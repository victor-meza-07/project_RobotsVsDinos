# project_RobotsVsDinos
"Description: because we have to be descriptive." 





MVP - "original" option, this is the submission, while I develop the other gamemodes

"Involved" is if you want to participate in the battle agaisnt dinos

"Multiplayer" Doesn't currently work; all methods for functionality are set up, but the deadine arrived and I didn't have time to make a chessboard with move rules for our dinos and robots.


BUGS - 
all realted to userinput, this game uses integers in order to check for input and will break if anything else is used.
